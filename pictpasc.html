<p align=center> <font size=15> <font color="white"> PICT ACM Association for computing machinery (ACM) is the worldâ€™s largest educational and scientific society, uniting educators, researchers and professors. PICT ACM student chapter (PASC) was established in 2011 with a view of fostering technical and non-technical qualities in an individual and helping them to shape their destiny. PASC started off with 4 founding members and in such a short period, PASC has grown to a big student chapter of nearly more than 220 ACM members. Appreciating our endeavour, PASC is awarded as BEST ACM STUDENT CHAPTER in India consecutively in 2018 and 2019.
